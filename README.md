# Schematic editing
To modify or create a schematic, you need to do the following steps first.
1. Get Minecraft and make sure you have the launcher installed and have run the game at least once on the latest version (14.4).
2. Go to https://fabricmc.net/use/ and download the Fabric installer for vanilla (latest version) and run the installer and follow its instructions.
3. Now (re)launch the Minecraft launcher and load the new Fabric profile (select it in the bottom bar).
4. Go to `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods` (the mods directory was just created).
5. Go to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structureutils and downlodad the jar file for 1.14
6. Go to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit and download the jar file for 1.14 with (Fabric for...) in the name.
7. Go to https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api and download the latest jar file for 1.14
8. Put all three jar files into the mods directory and relaunch the game (this tends to take a minute).
9. Create a new world in creative mode with superflat as world type.
10. Set the difficulty to peaceful in options.
11. Run the following commands: `/gamerule doWeatherCycle false` and `/gamerule doDaylightCycle false`. (this stops rain and night)
12. Now give yourself a structure block: `/give NAME minecraft:structure_block`.
13. All done.

Saved structures are saved to the generated directory in the world save.
